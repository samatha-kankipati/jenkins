CloudCafe Style Guide
=====================


General Guidelines
------------------
1. It is **HIGHLY** encouraged that if you have not already read (and even if
   it's been a while since you have) the Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)
   PEP-8 and PEP 20 that you do so.
2. Guidelines here are intended to help encourage code unity, they are not
   unbreakable rules, but should be adhered to failing a good reason not to.
3. When in doubt, **ALL** code should conform either directly to or in the
   spirit of Python PEP 20, if you are still in doubt, go with Python PEP-8.
4. If you really are still in doubt, see Guideline 2.
5. Base Classes are your friend. Use them when they make sense.


Rules of Law
------------
1. If a base class exists, use it. If the base class is missing features
   that you need, first try to make improvements to the base class before
   implementing a new one.
2. Functions should only return one type. Conditional returning of different
   types from a function should be last resort. If a function can return a
   single item or a list of items, choose to return a list of items always,
   even if that means returning a list with a single item.
3. All code should be as explicit as possible. Favor readability/clarity over
   brevity.
4. Common libraries should be favored over importing directly from other
   project code. The exception to this is importing clients, behaviors,
   and configurations for use in integration tests.
5. Once you have submitted a branch for review, the only changes that
   should be made to that branch should be changes requested by
   reviewers or functional issues.  Any follow on work should be submitted
   in a new branch.


Development Guidelines
----------------------
- Always use **SPACES**. **NEVER TABS**. All block indention should be
  four (4) spaces.
- Avoid single letter variable names except in the case of iterators,
  in which case a descriptive variable name would still be preferable
  if possible.
- Do not leave trailing whitespace or whitespace in blank lines.
- Put two newlines between top-level code (funcs, classes, etc).
- Use only UNIX style newlines ("\n"), not Windows style ("\r\n").
- Follow the ordering/spacing guidelines described in PEP8 for imports.
- Put one newline between methods in classes and anywhere else.
- Avoid using line continuations unless absolutely necessary. Preferable
  alternatives are to wrap long lines in parenthesis, or line breaking
  on the open parenthesis of a function call.
- When dealing with long lists of parameters, do not break to a new
  line after an equals sign. The parameter name and value should be
  on the same line for the sake of readability.
- Long strings should be handled by wrapping the string in parenthesis
  and having quote delimited strings per line within.
Example::
    long_string = ('I cannot fit this whole phrase on one '
                   'line, but I can properly format this string '
                   'by using this type of structure.')
- Do not write "except:", use "except Exception:" at the very least
- Use try/except where logical. Avoid wrapping large blocks of code in
  in huge try/except blocks.
- Use Enumerated Types where logical to pass around string constants
  or magic numbers between Functions, Methods, Classes and Packages.
  Python does not provide a default Enumerated Type data type, CloudCafe uses
  Class structs by naming convention in their place.
- Use specific assertions in favor of generic assertions (i.e. assertIsNone(x)
  instead of assertTrue(x is not None)).

Example::
  class ComputeServerStates(object):
      ACTIVE = "ACTIVE"
      BUILD = "BUILD"
      REBUILD = "REBUILD"
      ERROR = "ERROR"
      DELETING = "DELETING"
      DELETED = "DELETED"
      RESCUE = "RESCUE"
      PREP_RESCUE = "PREP_RESCUE"
      RESIZE = "RESIZE"
      VERIFY_RESIZE = "VERIFY_RESIZE"

- Blocks of code should either be self documenting and/or well commented,
  especially in cases of non-standard code.
- Use Python list comprehensions when possible. They can make large blocks
  of code collapse to a single line.
- String formatting via the new (as of python 2.4) .format() method is
  preferred over the older %s style encoding and ''.join() methods.
  (Note on ''.join():  This is OK to use and encouraged *if* you're actually
  creating a string from a large list of strings. Otherwise, ''.format()
  is the better choice).
- Commented out code should not be submitted. Non-functional code should be
  removed, and tests with issues should be marked to skip.



Test Data/Configuration
-----------------------
- Tests should make no assumptions on data exists. Test data should either
  be generated in a fixture, or be provided in a configuration file.
- Tests should be self contained. They should not rely on changes in state
  not performed in the test. The one exception to this rule is ordered tests,
  but even those are discouraged unless absolutely necessary.
- Each test/test class is responsible for deleting/or removing any resources
  creating during the test.
- Test asserts such as assertEqual() should written as if they were spoken
  verbally. Example: Asserting that a new value is equal to an
  older one would be written as: self.assertEqual(changed, original)


Imports
-------
- Do not use wildcard ``*`` import
- Do not make relative imports
- Imports should be broken into two sections: standard lib imports and your
  defined imports. Imports should be in alphabetical order within each section

Example::
    import json
    import lxml

    from cafe import Runner
    from foo.bar import Baz


Docstrings
----------
Example::

  """A one line docstring looks like this and ends in a period."""


  """A multi line docstring has a one-line summary, less than 80 characters.

  Then a new paragraph after a newline that explains in more detail any
  general information about the function, class or method. Example usages
  are also great to have here if it is a complex class for function.

  When writing the docstring for a class, an extra line should be placed
  after the closing quotations. For more in-depth explanations for these
  decisions see http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/
  """


Before Committing
-----------------
- Each pull request should address a single issue, ideally which should
  be described in a blueprint or bug. Pull requests that address multiple,
  unrelated issues will be closed and need to be resubmitted as separate
  submissions
- Always run a PEP8 check on your modified code before committing.
  You can do this with a plethora of tools such as flake8, pylint,
  and pyflakes.  **Once gating on PEP-8 rules is enabled, Gerrit will
  immediately reject any submission with PEP-8 issues.**
- Blocks of commented out code or configuration should not be submitted to trunk except
  in extraordinary cases.
- Tests that either validate nothing or simply have the "pass" statement
  should not be submitted.
- Only functional, **TESTED CODE** should be committed. There are no
  exceptions. This includes verify that code for other projects has not been
  broken if your changes effect common code. Until a gate job is in place,
  it is not time efficient for reviewers to execute all submitted code.
