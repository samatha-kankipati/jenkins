API & TEST REPOSITORY DOCUMENTATION:
================

The **entire** CloudCAFE project, every package, class, method, etc... is documented to the epydoc standard. There is a script in /build that will automatically
generate the most current version of the CloudCAFE documentation for you providing you have installed Epydoc (see REQUIRED SOFTWARE/PACKAGES below).

To generate the CloudCAFE API and test case documentation:
* cd to <REPO_LOCATION>CloudCAFE-Python/build
* Execute the script generateDocs.sh
* In the browser of your choice, open the file <REPO_LOCATION>CloudCAFE-Python/docs/api-doc/index.html for the API documentation
* In the browser of your choice, open the file <REPO_LOCATION>CloudCAFE-Python/docs/repo-doc/index.html for the Test Case Respository documentation
